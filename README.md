A Simple CQRS implementation that mimics the MediatR interfaces.

## Building Locally
You can use the cake file to build, test and publish:

Run: `dotnet cake --Target=NugetPackAndPush --NuGetSource="{source}" --NuGetApiKey="{key}"`

To write to a local folder:

Run: `dotnet cake --Target=NugetPackAndPush --NuGetSource="c:\package-source" --NuGetApiKey="key"`
